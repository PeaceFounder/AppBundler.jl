# Startup Configuration File (common startup.jl)
#
# This file runs after platform-specific arguments are set, allowing you to apply
# common startup options across all environments. Use this file to:
#   - Load development tools (e.g., Revise.jl for hot-reloading, Infiltrator.jl for debugging)
#   - Configure environment-specific settings
#   - Display diagnostic information about the Julia environment
#
# The diagnostic output below shows the active project, load paths, and depot paths
# to help verify your environment configuration.
